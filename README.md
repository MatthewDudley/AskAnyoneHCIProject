# AskAnyoneHCIProject
Human Computer Interaction Final Project

Ask Anyone is a cross platform mobile application built in Visual Studio using the Xamarin platform and .NET framework.
We wrote Ask Anyone using C# and XAML under a Xamarin.Forms cross platform project. The project consists of three folders, a shared 'AskAnyone' folder, 'AskAnyone.Droid', and 'AskAnyone.iOS'. The Xamarin project allows us to write all of our C# and XAML code in the shared 'AskAnyone' folder then when we run the platform specific project it pulls the code from the shared folder and compiles it down to platform specific code.

In its current state, Ask Anyone is a prototype and is not fully implemented for the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
We have tested the Android and iOS projects on multiple emulators as well as multiple Android phones.
We have not tested on any iOS devices due to not having bought a developer account through Apple but the project builds and runs on the iOS emulators. You will need emulators or devices that can be side loaded (Android device with developer settings unlocked or an Apple device with a developer account). 

If you have a device simply connect via USB to your computer and select the device in Visual Studio when you run the project. 
If you have an emulator select the emulator in Visual Studio when you run the project.
