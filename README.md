# AskAnyoneHCIProject
Human Computer Interaction Final Project

Ask Anyone is a cross platform mobile application built in Visual Studio using the Xamarin platform and .NET framework.
We wrote Ask Anyone using C# and XAML under a Xamarin.Forms cross platform project.

In its current state, Ask Anyone is a prototype and is not fully implemented for the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
We have tested the Android and iOS builds on multiple emulators as well as multiple Android phones.
We have not tested on any iOS devices due to not having bought a developer account yet for any iPhones but the project builds and runs on the iOS emulators.
